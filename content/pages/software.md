title: Open-Source Software

This is a list of open-source software I've written or co-authored.
Most of the code is available on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/yasserglez) account.

* [copulaedas](https://github.com/yasserglez/copulaedas)
  -- R package for implementing and studying estimation of
  distribution algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas.
* [vines](https://github.com/yasserglez/vines) -- R implementation
  of the vine graphical model for building high-dimensional
  probability distributions as a factorization of bivariate copulas
  and marginal density functions.
* [cec2005benchmark](https://github.com/yasserglez/cec2005benchmark)
  -- R wrapper for the C code of the 25 benchmark functions
  for the CEC 2005 Special Session on Real-Parameter Optimization.
* [cec2013](https://github.com/hzambran/cec2013) -- R wrapper
  for the C code of 28 benchmark functions for the CEC 2013 Special
  Session and Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective
  Optimization.
* [ngram_profile](https://github.com/yasserglez/ngram_profile)
  -- Python library for text classification based on character n-grams.
* [pagerank-hadoop](https://github.com/yasserglez/pagerank-hadoop)
  -- PageRank implementation in Hadoop.
* [dml](https://github.com/yasserglez/dml) -- C library for dependence
  modeling using C-vines, D-vines and R-vines.
* [diglib](https://github.com/yasserglez/diglib) -- Personal digital
  document management software written in Python and GTK.
* [Arachne](https://github.com/yasserglez/arachne) -- Search engine
  for files shared via FTP and similar protocols.
* [PyTiger2C](https://github.com/yasserglez/pytiger2c) -- A compiler
  for the Tiger programming language written in Python.
* [lr4ir-matlab](https://github.com/yasserglez/lr4ir-matlab)
  -- MATLAB project for research on learning to rank for
  information retrieval.

  -- Implementation of a group of metaheuristics in C#.
* [pyenscript](https://github.com/yasserglez/pyenscript) -- A simple
  Python wrapper for the Evernote ENScript.exe executable.

I've also made smaller contributions to the following open-source projects.

* [pymdptoolbox](https://github.com/sawcordwell/pymdptoolbox)
  -- Markov decision process toolbox for Python.
* [pyeasyga](https://github.com/remiomosowon/pyeasyga)
