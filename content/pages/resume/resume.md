## Experience

2018&ndash;present
:   **Research Scientist.**<br>
    Amazon, Canada.

    * Working on natural language understanding and entity resolution in Alexa.

2017&ndash;2018
:   **Senior Data Scientist.**<br>
    Canopy Labs, Canada.

    * Led the development of recommender systems and customer
      propensity models using Spark, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow,
      scikit-learn, and xgboost.
    * Built recurrent neural networks for predictive customer analytics
      based on the customer's historical sequence of actions.

2015&ndash;2017
:   **Data Scientist.**<br>
    Canopy Labs, Canada.

    * Developed large-scale recommender systems for different industries
      such as online retail and travel. Participated in the definition
      of the business metrics as well as the design, implementation
      and evaluation of the systems in production.
    * Used technologies such as Spark (with Python and Scala),
      Mesos, YARN, Amazon EMR, S3, and MongoDB.

2013&ndash;2015
:   **Research & Teaching Assistant.**<br>
    York University, Canada.

    * Designed and implemented reinforcement learning techniques to
      optimize the user interaction in configuration processes.
    * Proposed methodologies to improve search heuristics on
      multimodal optimization problems.
    * Implemented scientific software in Python (using NumPy, pandas
      and SciPy), R and MATLAB/Octave.

2011&ndash;2013
:   **Research Assistant.**<br>
    Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics, Cuba.

    * Developed new estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) using
      copulas and vines to model the probability distributions.
    * Implemented a group of R packages available on CRAN,
      and a C library for dependence modeling using vines.
