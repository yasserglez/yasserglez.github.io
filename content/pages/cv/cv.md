## Experience

2017&ndash;present
:   <p>**Senior Data Scientist.**<br>
Canopy Labs, Canada.</p>

2015&ndash;2017
:   **Data Scientist.**<br>
    Canopy Labs, Canada.

    * Developed large-scale recommender systems for diverse
      application domains -- participating in the definition of the
      requirements and business metrics as well as the design,
      implementation and evaluation of the systems in production.
    * Employed technologies such as Spark with Python and Scala
      running on Mesos and YARN, Amazon EMR & S3 and MongoDB.

2013&ndash;2015
:   **Research & Teaching Assistant.**<br>
    York University, Canada.

    * Designed and implemented reinforcement learning techniques to
      optimize the user interaction in a configuration process.
    * Developed methodologies to improve the performance of search
      heuristics on multimodal optimization problems.
    * Implemented scientific software in Python (using NumPy, pandas
      and SciPy), R and MATLAB/Octave.

2011&ndash;2013
:   **Research Assistant.**<br>
    Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics, Cuba.

    * Developed new estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) using
      copulas and vines to model the probability distributions.
    * Implemented a group of R packages available on CRAN,
      and a C library for dependence modeling using vines.
