save_as: index.html

My name is Yasser. I am passionate about solving challenging problems
using machine learning. My main interests are in areas of artificial
intelligence and machine learning such as deep learning, natural
language processing, reinforcement learning, optimization,
evolutionary computation and recommender systems.

I work as a research scientist at
[Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/science)
in Toronto. Previously, I was a data scientist at
[Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/) exploring the applications of
deep learning for customer analytics and developing recommender
systems for various domains. I have a bachelor's degree in computer
science and a master's degree in information systems & technology with
an emphasis on mathematical optimization.

Please see [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, publicly available
software that I have developed, and additional background information.
