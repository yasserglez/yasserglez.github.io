title: Hello
save_as: index.html

Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable ML solutions to real-world
problems. In particular, I'm interested in applications of recommender
systems, search and information retrieval, ranking, representation
learning, and natural language processing.

I work at Shopify as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer building
large-scale recommender systems for [Shop](https://shop.app/).
Prior to Shopify, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon working on
natural language understanding and entity resolution in
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa); and a Data Scientist at
[Canopy Labs](https://betakit.com/drop-acquires-predictive-analytics-company-canopy-labs/)
where I built recommender systems and other predictive models for
different industries such as retail and travel.
