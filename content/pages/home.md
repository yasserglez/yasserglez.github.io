title: Hello, I'm Yasser
save_as: index.html

I'm passionate about the design and implementation of algorithms to
solve challenging problems and draw conclusions from data. I have a
keen interest in data science and love working with open-source
technologies.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree
in Information Systems & Technology. I work as a data scientist at
Canopy Labs &ndash; a predictive customer analytics company based in
Toronto. In the past I've worked as a research assistant at the
Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics in Cuba; and at York
University in Canada &ndash; using mostly Python and R to solve
different optimization-related problems.

You can read [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, open-source
software I have developed, and background information.
