title: Hello, I'm Yasser
save_as: index.html

I like solving challenging problems using machine learning. More
specifically, I'm interested in practical applications of AI and
machine learning related to deep learning, natural language
processing, recommender systems, optimization, reinforcement learning,
and evolutionary computation.

Currently, I work at Amazon as a research scientist on natural language
understanding and entity resolution in [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/science).
Previously, I was a data scientist at [Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/)
where I built recommender systems and customer propensity models for
different industries such as online retail and travel. I have a bachelor's
degree in computer science and a master's degree with an emphasis on
mathematical optimization.

Please see [my resume](resume/) for a list of publications, open
source software, and additional background information.
