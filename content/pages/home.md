title: Hello, I'm Yasser
save_as: index.html

I'm a computer scientist living in Toronto, Canada. I'm passionate
about the design and implementation of algorithms to solve challenging
problems and draw conclusions from data. My interests include the
areas of optimization, machine learning, natural language processing
and data analysis &ndash; many of which fall within the emerging field
of data science. I love working with open-source technologies, started
10 years ago and haven't stopped since then.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm close to
completing a master's in Information Systems & Technology. I've worked
as research assistant at the Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics and
Physics in Cuba; and at York University in Canada &ndash; using mostly
R and Python to solve different optimization-related problems.

You can read [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, open-source
software I have developed, and detailed skills.
