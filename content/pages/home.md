title: About
save_as: index.html

My name is Yasser Gonzalez. I'm passionate about solving challenging
problems that require developing scalable predictive models and
drawing conclusions from large datasets. I have a particular interest
in machine learning, deep learning, optimization and recommender systems.

Recently I've been focusing on exploring the applications of deep
learning for customer analytics and developing recommender systems for
diverse application domains &ndash; employing technologies such as
Apache Spark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, and Scala. I have a
bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in
Information Systems & Technology with emphasis on applied mathematics.

I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at Canopy Labs, a predictive
customer analytics company based in Toronto. In the past, I've worked
as research assistant at York University in Canada and the Institute
of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics in Cuba &ndash; studying solution
methods for mathematical optimization problems and their applications.

Please see [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, publicly available
software I have developed, and additional background information.
