title: Hello, I'm Yasser
save_as: index.html

I'm a computer scientist living in Toronto, Canada. I'm passionate
about the design and implementation of algorithms to solve challenging
problems and draw conclusions from data. My interests include the
areas of optimization, machine learning, natural language processing
and data analysis -- many of which fall within the emerging field of
data science. I started working with open-source technologies 10 years
ago, and I haven't stopped since.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm close to
completing a master's degree in Information Systems & Technology.
I've worked as research assistant at the Institute of Cybernetics,
Mathematics and Physics in Cuba, and at York University in Canada --
using mostly R and Python to solve different optimization-related
problems. You can read [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications,
open-source software I have developed, and detailed skills.
