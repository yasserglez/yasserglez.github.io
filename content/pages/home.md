title: Hello, I'm Yasser
save_as: index.html

I'm passionate about the design and implementation of algorithms to
solve challenging problems that require building scalable predictive
models and drawing conclusions from large datasets. I have a keen
interest in data science and I'm enthusiastic about working with
open-source technologies.

Lately I've been focusing on the development of recommender systems
for various application domains &ndash; employing technologies such as
Apache Spark with Python and Scala, Amazon EMR & S3, and MongoDB.
I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree
in Information Systems & Technology with emphasis on applied mathematics.

I currently work as a data scientist at Canopy Labs, a predictive
customer analytics company based in Toronto. In the past I've worked
as research assistant at York University in Canada and the Institute
of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics in Cuba &ndash; studying
solution methods for mathematical optimization problems and their
applications.

Please refer to [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, publicly
available software that I have developed, and additional background
information.
