title: About
save_as: index.html

My name is Yasser Gonzalez. I am passionate about solving challenging
problems that require developing scalable machine learning models and
drawing conclusions from large datasets. My main interests are in
areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning such as deep
learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning,
optimization, evolutionary computation, and recommender systems.

I work as a research scientist on
[Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/science)
in Toronto. Previously, I was a data scientist at
[Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/) exploring the applications of
deep learning for customer analytics and developing recommender
systems for various domains. I have a bachelor's degree in computer
science and a master's degree in information systems & technology with
an emphasis on mathematical optimization.

Please see [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, publicly available
software that I have developed, and additional background information.
