save_as: index.html

My name is Yasser Gonzalez. I'm passionate about solving practical
problems using machine learning. In particular, I'm interested in
applications of AI and machine learning related to ranking and
information retrieval, natural language processing, recommender
systems, and mathematical optimization.

I work at Amazon as a research scientist on natural language
understanding and entity resolution in [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/science).
Previously, I was a data scientist at [Canopy Labs](https://canopylabs.com/)
where I built recommender systems and customer propensity models for
multiple industries such as online retail and travel.
