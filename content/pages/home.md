save_as: index.html

My name is Yasser Gonzalez. I'm passionate about solving challenging
problems that require developing scalable predictive models and
drawing conclusions from large datasets. I have a particular interest
in machine learning, deep learning, optimization and recommender systems.

Recently, I've been focusing on exploring the applications of deep
learning for customer analytics and recommender systems in diverse
domains â€“ making use of technologies such as Spark, PyTorch, Keras,
TensorFlow, Python and Scala. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer
Science and a master's degree in Information Systems & Technology with
an emphasis on mathematical optimization.

I currently work as Senior Data Scientist at Canopy Labs, a predictive
customer analytics company based in Toronto. In the past, I've worked
as research assistant at York University in Canada and the Institute
of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Physics in Cuba &ndash; studying
solution methods for optimization problems and their applications.

Please see [my CV](cv/) for a list of publications, publicly available
software I have developed, and additional background information.
