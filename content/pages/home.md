title: Hello
save_as: index.html

I’m passionate about solving practical problems using machine learning
at scale. In particular, I’m interested in applications related to
information retrieval and ranking, recommender systems, representation
learning, natural language processing, and optimization.

I work at Shopify as a staff machine learning engineer building
large-scale recommendation systems for [Shop](https://shop.app/).
Prior to Shopify, I was an applied scientist at Amazon working on
natural language understanding and entity resolution in
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa); and a data scientist at
[Canopy Labs](https://betakit.com/drop-acquires-predictive-analytics-company-canopy-labs/)
where I built recommender systems for online retail and travel companies.
